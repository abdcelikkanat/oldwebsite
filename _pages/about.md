I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Section for Cognitive Section](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/cogsys), [DTU Compute](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english). I have been working on learning the structure and dynamics of dynamic complex networks under the guidance of Prof. [Sune Lehmann](https://sunelehmann.com/) and Prof. [Morten Mørup](mortenmorup.dk). 

I obtained my Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Assist. Prof. [Fragkiskos Malliaros](https://fragkiskos.me/) and Prof. [Nikos Paragios](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7edhlaQAAAAJ) at [CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/), [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), where I was also a member of the [Centre for Visual Computing](https://cvn.centralesupelec.fr/) and the [Inria OPIS](https://opis-inria.eu/) team. My doctoral research was oriented around developing representation learning methods for graph-structured data. 

Before my Ph.D. studies, I received my Bachelor degree in Mathematics and my Master's degree in Computer Engineering from [Boğaziçi University](https://www.boun.edu.tr/en_US). I worked with Prof. [Ali Taylan Cemgil](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cemgil/) during my Master's thesis studies on random graphs with prescribed degree distributions and their applications.
