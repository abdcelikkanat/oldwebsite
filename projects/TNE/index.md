## <center>TNE: Topical Node Embeddings</center>
### Motivation
##### *TNE (Topical Node Embeddings)* is a general framework to enhance the embeddings of nodes acquired by means of the random walk-based approaches. The proposed method assigns each vertex to a topic/commmunity label with the favor of various statistical models and community detection methods, and then generates the enhanced community representations.
